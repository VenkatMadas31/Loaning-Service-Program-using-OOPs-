# PClub-Recruitment-Task
## Answer to the question given as a recruitment task for the project- Deep Dive into Web 3.0   

* The code written by me can be executed by running the file with extension .cpp in a compatible code editor/compiler such as *VS Code* or even simple compilers like *Turbo C++*.
* <p>The code will help a lender to lend out a loan to a borrower easily. It has been written using the *C++* language. The code contains functions to take inputs for the required amount of loan (The principle amount) and also other factors like collateral, rate of interest, tenure in which the loan is supposed to be paid off, etc.</p>
* <p>The code, as a result, outputs the final details to both the borrower and the lender. It shows the final amount to be paid, the Equated monthly installment calculated corresponding to the tenure period of the loan, and so on. Also, the code stops it's execution as soon as it comes to know that the borrower does not have proper collateral.</p>
* Moreover, the loaning system that I have imlemented is decentralized one.
  * The centralized system does have certain factors that can be considered as demerits.
  * In centralized systems, the powers of the organization are in the hands of a particular group of people whereas,in decentralized system, the power is distributed       among a group of people. This allows for more opinions to be considered and also a greater amount of audience is satisfied.
  * Descision making is faster in decentralized mode as compared to centralized mode.
  * Because in centralized loaning systems, the powers are held with particular group of people, it fails to cover all the classes of borrowers.
  * Centralized loaning systems are effective when they are considering to lend only to a small amount of borrowers.
